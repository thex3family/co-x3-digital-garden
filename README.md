## Frontmatter
This is where we put in the metadata that the backend will read when the note is published. 

### Note/Article Submissions Must Include:

**title:**

**description:** You can use this for subtitles or simple descriptions. This can be left blank, ex. ''.

**tags:** ex. ['Co-x3', 'tag2', 'tag3']

**growthStage:** seedling, budding, evergreen

For reference, we are using [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/) definitions for seedling, budding, and evergreen. Here they are:

> **Seedling:** Seedlings are ideas I've just started that are rough, unrefined, and need some time to grow.
> 
> **Budding:** Buddings are ideas I've revised and worked on a bit. They're starting to grow, but still need refinement.
> 
> **Evergreen:** Evergreens are ideas I've invested significant time into. They are refined, edited, and won't significantly change – aside from the occasional trimming.

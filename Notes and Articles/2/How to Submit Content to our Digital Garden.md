### Welcome!

So.... You want to submit content to our digital garden? You have come to the right place. 

Before we start, I'm going to make the following assumptions:

1. You aren't a programmer.
2. You use Obsidian, and you want to be able to easily reference items from our digital garden from within your vault.

With that out of the way, here are the steps:

> By the way, this is a lot of steps to set things up. However, things will be much quicker once everything is set up. Additionally, we will be implementing a WYSIWIG (What You See is What You Get) editor on the Co-x3 Digital Garden website that does all of this for you. It will be a part of the next wave of features. Follow @Co-x3-World-Bosses on Twitter in order to stay up-to-date with the Co-x3 Digital Garden and our other world bosses.

#### Step 1 - Join Co-x3. If you are already a member, you can skip this step.

Joining Co-x3 is completely free. All you have to do is complete the four steps that are a part of this article: [Day 1 With The Family - The Checklist](https://academy.co-x3.com/en/articles/5115867-day-1-with-the-family-the-checklist?utm_source=email)

#### Step 2 - Create a GitHub account. If you already have an account, you can skip this step.

You can create an account by going to the following webpage: [Sign up for GitHub](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)  

#### Step 3 - Download GitHub Desktop. If you already use it or use a different method to clone repositories to your computer, then you can skip this step.

You can find the download link here: [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

#### Step 4 - Visit Co-x3 Digital Garden Repository on GitHub

Here's the link to the repository: [Co-x3 Digital Garden Repo on GitHub](https://github.com/thex3family/co-x3-digital-garden)

#### Step 5 - Fork/Copy the Repository to your Account

Before being accessible on the Co-x3 Digital Website, all entries must first be submitted to this repository. The first step to do this is by forking the repo so that it is copied to your account.

Once done, you should see that you are currently at the forked version of the Co-x3 Digital Garden repository.

#### Step 6 - Open GitHub Desktop on your computer and Clone/Copy this repo to a folder on your computer

#### Step 7 - Go inside of this folder and copy the digital garden folder, ex. co-x3-digital-garden

#### Step 8 - Copy this folder and Paste it into your Obsidian Vault

#### Step 9 - Open GitHub Desktop and make it focus on the folder from Step 8

#### Step 10 - Use GitHub Desktop to create a branch for your submission

Please use the following format for the name of your branch: username-shortened-title, ex. joshwingreene-how-to-submit-conten

#### Step 11 - Open the Notes and Article subfolder of the co-x3-digital-garden and create a folder

For the folder's name, please pick a number that hasn't been chosen yet. This number will serve as the unique public key for your submission. If you are editing an item, this number won't change.

#### Step 12 - Create a new file inside of this folder

The name of the file should have spaces if the note/article has more than one word, ex. "How to Submit Content to our Digital Garden".

#### Step 13 - Visit the template and copy it to your newly created file

Here's the link: [Template for Notes or Articles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thex3family/co-x3-digital-garden/main/Templates/PublicKey-SimplifiedTitleOfNoteOrArticle/Example%20Note.md)

#### Step 14 - Replace the content under the second "---" with your note/article's content

#### Step 15 - Update your piece's frontmatter metadata appropriately

You can read our requirements for the frontmatter metadata properties here: [Co-x3 Digital Garden - README](https://github.com/thex3family/co-x3-digital-garden/blob/main/README.md)

#### Step 16 - Use GitHub Desktop to create a commit

#### Step 17 - Use GitHub Desktop to push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub

#### Step 18 - Go back to your forked repository on GitHub and Submit a Pull Request to the original repository

If your note or article includes images, please add them to a shared folder and include a link to it in the Pull Request description. Our moderators will respond to you with a GitHub issue that includes these images. You will need to update your piece so that the associated urls point to the urls of the images in the issue.

If your piece is approved, your piece will be merged into the digital garden and will be available on the main digital garden website. 

Make sure to keep your fork updated so that you can reference the new pieces that are added by your fellow Co-x3 community members.

And, that's it. Congrats! You can now submit content to our digital garden!

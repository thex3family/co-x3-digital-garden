# [[co-x3-digital-garden/Notes and Articles/3/Digital Garden Moderation]]
## Welcome to the Co-x3 Digital Garden! 
Thanks for taking a look at the digital garden! This article intends to make users of the digital garden aware of how written works are published to the site, as well as moderation steps, definitions, and requirements for publishing. 

## Submission Expectations
Some things to keep in mind before you enter your written work into the Co-x3 Digital Garden: 
- All of the data shared with the digital garden is publicly viewable!
	- Ideally the notes will change and develop over time.
	- The tags of a work may change as a written work develops.
	- Content should be constructive, helpful, and fair.
- By submitting a written work to the digital garden, you are allowing your work to be referenced or linked by other members of the digital garden. 
- Do not plagiarize - if you want to reference another work (not included in the digital garden), use APA style citations: 
	- ref: https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_style_introduction.html
	- submissions to the digital garden may have links to other works within it by using two square brackets around the name of the work. We want to know when ideas are getting inspiration from each other!
	- members may also embed sections of other works within the digital garden space. 
- [[How to Submit Content to our Digital Garden]]
- Content will be reviewed to determine:
	1. That the pull request is following the [social contract](https://join.co-x3.com/social-contract).
	2. That the work has relevant tags and correct frontmatter.
	3. That the changes do not have glaring grammatical issues.
	4. That the intent of the written work is clear.
	5. That the written work will be safe for the community. 

## Definitions 
All pieces on the digital garden are written works submitted by members via the GitHub repository linked [here](https://github.com/thex3family/digital-garden-notes). 
- Types of written works ('type' property on a written work):
	- **articles** - combination of concepts, linking notes together, usually has a narrative or agenda.
	- **notes** - atomic, one main idea or concept, may be a building block for an article.
- Types of growth stages ('growthStage' property on a written work):
	- definitions pulled from Maggie Appleton's digital garden definitions [here](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)
	- **seedling** - ideas that are rough, unrefined, and need some time to grow.
	- **budding** - ideas that have been revised and worked on a bit. They are starting to grow, but still might need refinement.
	- **evergreen** - ideas where time has been significantly invested, tend to be refined, edited, and won't significantly change, aside from the occasional trimming.
- Tags ('tags' property on a written work):
	- Tags are used for organizing the content on the digital garden site and will also be used for future search features
		- You can see all of the tags currently available on the repository [here](https://github.com/thex3family/digital-garden-notes/tree/main/Tags).
		- New tags and changes to the tag documentation can also be added via pull request the same way that written works are. 
	- users have two levels of censoring that they can optionally apply to their account 
		- warning-list
			- Provide warnings (ex. via a modal, color change) for the tags put into the warning-list
		- block-list 
			- if a user saves a tag to their block-list, this will stop the individual user from seeing content that contains the tag

## Pre-Moderation Process for Publishing Changes 
A user must initiate a pull request from their version of the repository with the committed changes they want to make. This pull request is then to go to a moderator for approval of the changes. 
Steps for the moderator: 
1. Ensure that content resulting from the pull request is following the [social contract](https://join.co-x3.com/social-contract).
2. Make sure that the note has the relevant tags and correct frontmatter.
	- Moderators will consult reference material to determine tags relevant to the written work.
		- Ex. Wikipedia or Merriam-Webster dictionary 
	- Currently available Tags: Law, Technology, Sports, Society, Self, Science, Religion, News, Leisure, Health, Politics, Food, Finance, Fashion, Education, Design, Business, Arts, Gore, Self Harm, Productivity, Psychology, Movies, Co-x3
3. Ensure written work that is changed does not have glaring grammatical issues and that the intent of the written work is clear.
